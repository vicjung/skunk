# Blogging with Markdown

Markdown is an ultra-simple markup language that allows you to format text using any editor. When you place such a file (.md) in the `/markdown-blog/` folder, it automatically becomes a blog post.

Below you'll find some important information specific to SkunkHTML, as well as a comprehensive tutorial on how to write Markdown.

## Creating a blog post

Create a new text file and make a blog post header inside. In Markdown, headers are marked with the `#` symbol. For example:

```
# Testing SkunkHTML

I don't know how it works yet, but I'll find out!
```
Name this file using a date in any format, but it's important that it starts with a number. For example `2024-12-27.md` (.md is the standard extension for Markdown files)

Place this file in the `/markdown-blog/` folder. If you're doing this on GitHub with  Pages enabled, you'll see your new post appear on your site shortly:

![first-blog-post.png](images/first-blog-post.png)

It's that simple! Just remember that you use `#` to mark your page title, and to use date in file name. Later in the file, you can use additional headers freely. Only the first one matters for the blog post title.

Markdown is super convenient if you just want to write something without fiddling with HTML, and that's exactly how SkunkHTML works.

# Lists

```
* Unordered lists will start with asterisks
- Or with dashes
+ Or with plus signs

1. To create an ordered list, You can start lines with numbers followed by periods
    1. Indent with 4 spaces or a tab to create sub-items
    2. Use further indentation to create nested lists
        - It's possible to mix and match list types

2. Sub-lists within unordered lists will use different markers automatically:
    * Any marker can be used for the first level
    + And any marker for new sub-levels:
        * You can use asterisks
        + Or plus signs
        - Or dashes
```

```

# Links

```
[Example website](https://www.example.net)

[Same website with a title](https://www.example.net "Example Website")

[Link to a file in the project](./images/skunk-final.png)

[Numbers can be used for reference links][1]

Or simply [text as the reference].

URLs will automatically become links: https://www.example.net or <https://www.example.net>.

... and here are some reference links defined later in the document that won't be visible in the rendered HTML:

[1]: https://www.example.net
[text as the reference]: https://www.example.net
```

[eye_image_reference]: images/eye.png "The Eye"

Regular:

![Skunk drawing](images/skunk-drawing.jpg)

Regular, with title:

![Skunk final](images/skunk-final.png "Skunk")

# Ignoring formatting

It is possible to ignore Markdown fomatting by placing a backslash before the Markdown character.

```
For example, \*this text won't be italicized\*.
```

# Code blocks

```
Backticks can be used to highlight code inline, like this:

"To print "Hello, F#!" in F#, you can use the `printfn` function".

And triple backticks can be used to highlight code blocks:

ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿```ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿fsharp
let greet name =
    printfn "Hello, %s!" name

greet "F#"

ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿```ï»¿ï»¿ï»¿
```

Backticks can be used to highlight code inline, like this:

"To print "Hello, F#!" in F#, you can use the `printfn` function".

And triple backticks can be used to highlight code blocks:

```fsharp
let greet name =
    printfn "Hello, %s!" name

greet "F#"
```
Remember to specify the language name immediately after the three backticks (in this case fsharp) if you want syntax highlighting to work!

# Inline HTML

```
Inline HTML is partially supported. Sometimes it can be useful, for example to strikethrough text:

<del>This text will be striked through</del>.

For some reason regular strikethrough is not supported. Proof: ~~This text is not striked through~~.
